        episodeTitle: 'Hello',
        content: `In this chapter the author was obviously hesistant to call a preface he explains that game design might be considered a science and seems to have very science like attributes but unfortunately no patterns have emerged which might reliably point you towards "This is a good design for a game" sort of thing. I'm somewhat surprised by this given there are a lot of other creative arts which have exactly this. Video game design is a new art form but game design certainly isn't I'm surprised that no one has had the time and inclination yet to try and distill some of the contents. I hope this book is an attempt at that. Later in the chapter it seems that is exactly the intent of the book and I'm happy`,

        content: `We discover here that YOU are a designer. Feels good. Because being a "game designer" is such a fuzzy term the author feels there is no need to let your imposter syndrome get in the way of thinking that you're a game designer. He then goes on to explain all the knowledge a game designer needs to be successful. Seems like a lot, he explains this is because a designer is trying to communicate to such a large audience, and doing so blind no less, knowing how people tick is important. The author suggests that listening can be a powerful tool, I dig that`,

        episodeTitle: 'The Designer Creates an Experience',
        content: `This is exactly the content I came here for. This sort of distilled experience from someone who knows what they're talking about. In this chapter the author explains that as a game designer you aren't designing a game so much as you're designing an experience. This sounds totally self absorbed when I explain it that way but it makes a lot of sense. Essentially the goal of the game designer isn't to create a game for creating a games sake what you want to do with your game is allow someone to play it and make them feel a certain way, scared, happy, accomplished. It's that experience that made them feel that way, that's what you're aiming for. So by focusing on the experience as you design your game hopefuly you end up designing a better game`,

      'I started reading this book many years ago, at the time I had a PDF that feel off the back of a truck. Not sure what happened to that but probably best I buy the official one when it comes time to read this. One thing I have heard was that this book was more aimed at designers working in big companies rather than solo indie devs. Still would be good to see how people in the industry do things if nothing else',
