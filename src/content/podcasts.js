I hope things change in future episodes`,

The podcast starts with the two hosts suggesting that they aren't professional podcasters and they're kind of right in that they spend half the episode listing all their experience and credentials. By the time they start talking games they talk about whether to go with a publisher or not and the talk seems fairly "in the time" of the recording. I'm not confident that there is a heap of information that is relevant to making games today. Although I could be wrong, maybe I just don't know how to apply the knowledge there in yet`,

There wasn't a lot to learn here about game design itself they spent the time talking about whether or not you should go for a publisher or not. It seems from what they say that publishers are a bit of a dying breed, in the mobile space at least. It seems the barrier to entry to make games isn't what it used to be which reduces some of the power that publishers once had over developers and game creators in general`,

Not really any "knowledge gems" I don't think but I think it was worth listening to and the videos that Richard Terrell does on Mario maker look like they're worth looking into`,
